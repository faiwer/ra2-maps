# Red Alert 2: Maps

Just a simple vibe-coded project. It's a simple gallery that allows navigating through predefined screenshots of Red Alert 2 maps. It supports fuzzy search, zooming in and out, navigating between images.

Why? There are way too many maps. I can remember them all. It's simpler when I can open this app, type a few characters and see the map's nuances.
